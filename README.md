Website for site of web things. Clone of a site I made several months ago.




Made by Link Dooley. 

This will (eventually)TM serve as a central hub for my projects, information about me (Because having that tied to your name can only go spectacularly on the internet!) and what I do, and things of that nature. 
The problem is that requires time. Which.. I don't have right now. So this page is a WIP until I find the time to make that... not the case.
